# Airline Reservation System (Java + JDBC)

A console-based Airline Reservation System developed using **Java**, **JDBC**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**, following core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** principles.

This project demonstrates how a real-world reservation system can be designed with persistent storage, proper abstraction, and clean separation of concerns.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Java  
- JDBC  
- Microsoft SQL Server  
- OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming)

---

## ✨ Features

- Book airline tickets
- Cancel tickets using Passenger ID
- View all booked passengers
- Search passenger by ID
- Persistent seat availability (does not reset on restart)
- Persistent passenger data
- Revenue calculation from database
- Console-based user interface

---

## 🧠 OOPS Concepts Used

- **Abstraction** – `ReservationSystem` abstract class
- **Inheritance** – `FlightReservation` extends `ReservationSystem`
- **Polymorphism** – Parent reference holding child object
- **Encapsulation** – Private fields with getters/setters
- **Method Overriding** – Booking and cancellation logic
- **Association** – Flight has passengers
- **Enum Usage** – Gender and SeatClass

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Flights Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Flights (
    FlightCode VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    Economy INT,
    PremiumEconomy INT,
    Business INT,
    Standby INT,
    Waiting INT
);
